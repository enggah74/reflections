#1 When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
One needs a remote repository when the application code will be shared by more than one programmer. This way each programmer can pull each other's code once individual changes are pushed to the remote repository.

#2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? You are not ready to get the latest commit especially if your own local changes are not ready and still have bugs.

#3 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - when you want to clone a repository in github
Clone - copy a remote or local repository into one's local repository
Branch - copy a repository into another local repository.
